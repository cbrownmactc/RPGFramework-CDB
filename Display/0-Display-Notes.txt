Our output uses Spectre.Console so that we can format things nicely in the terminal.

Spectre Color reference:

Color and styling can be set using Spectre's markup language. Here are some examples:
[red]This text is red[/] - Notice how we need to close the tag with [/]
[blue on yellow]This text is blue on yellow background[/]


Spectre also supports using Style objects, which might be better for most things
because they can be reused. Here's an example of creating a Style object:
var warningStyle = new Style(foreground: Color.Yellow, decoration: Decoration.Bold);
